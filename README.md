# Coordination Cloak Utility

## Overview
**Coordination Cloak Utility** enhances your experience using the Cloak of Coordination and similar teleportation cloaks in World of Warcraft by automatically managing your cloak gear swaps. It equips the teleportation cloak before use and then re-equips your original cloak afterward, streamlining the process during gameplay.

---

## Features
- **Automatic Detection:** Automatically detects and equips the appropriate teleportation cloak based on your faction and available cloaks in your inventory.
- **Auto Re-Equip:** After teleportation, the addon automatically re-equips your original cloak to ensure you're always geared properly.
- **Simple Command:** Use `/ccu` to trigger the cloak swap. The addon will handle the rest.
- **On-Screen Button:** An optional button appears when a teleportation cloak is equipped, allowing you to manually use the cloak if desired.
